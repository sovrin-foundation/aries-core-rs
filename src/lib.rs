//! The core functionality for implementing an Aries agent.
//!
//! The core functionality consists of three components
//!
//! 1. Frontend - This is used to communicate to the agent
//! 2. Backend  - This is used to communicate to the system behind the agent
//! 3. Storage  - This is used by the agent to store information that is only accessible by the agent
//!
//! Each of these is pluggable and can be used to create your own custom agent.
//!
//! ## Frontend
//!
//! The frontend protocol my use HTTP as its protocol and is the default. It opens an HTTP port and then
//! switches to use websockets. Another frontend could use Noise sockets or another protocol.
//! Each must be configurable via the `--features=` option at compile time. Multiple backends may be
//! used.
//!
//! ## Backend
//!
//! Backend system represent resources to which the agent will act as the entry point.
//! For example, an agent could be used to talk to the Indy or Sawtooth blockchains which use ZMQ.
//! Again, this must be configurable via the `--features=` option at compile time.
//!
//! ## Storage
//!
//! The storage layer is how the agent will store state and other information long term.
//! This should be separate from the backend system but doesn't have to be.
//! Again, this must be configurable via the `--features=` option at compile time.
//! The focus of this project is to enable secure, misuse-resistant agent storage.
//!
//! Storage is composed of the authentication layer
//! the data protection layer, and data persistance layer.
//!
//! Authentication is how a connection to the storage is
//! created and authorized.
//!
//! Data protection handles encrypting/decrypting data
//! depending on how the system is to be architected.
//! This layer could be bundled with authentication and/or
//! the persistance layer. This is decoupled to allow
//! for better flexibility
//!
//! Data persistance is just putting the data where it can
//! be retrieved later. This could be a database, files, cloud storage, or memory.
